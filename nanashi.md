# Nanashi

I'm not sure about exactly where they come, but the first information about this type came from a forum [SFK Aquatics](https://skfaquatics.com/forum/forums/topic/6137-new-types-of-shrimp-appeared/) and they make reference to beautifull shrimps in Japan in 2014!

But what makes a Nanashi shrimp? Basicly Nanashi is a Taitibee Pinto shrimp with some patterns and is a group of patterns, is not only one.

I really try to find good descriptions (maybe some draws...) about the standard but I fail :(. So I'm collecting information from youtube videos and will try to write here the standard. Probably I will understand something wrong, if you found some opportunity to inprove this definition, please open an issue and send a update :-D 

List of videos talking about This standard:

In video N01 Nanashi is described as an variation of Caridina Pinto and I agree they are very similar. And is classified as "group of patterns" and not only a simple pattern like an tiger shrimp. Some examples:
- Nanashi Tiger
    - Can have 2 or 3 stripes
- Advanced Nanashi
- Nanashi Mosura

In common for all samples in this video we have:
- Spider Legs (1)
- Head with a mask (2)
- Solid color in pinto standard (3)
- Solid color in end of tail (almost all white)
