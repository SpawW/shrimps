# shrimps

Shrimps are really gorgeous.

We are a big community arround the world creating new variations each year. Because that every year we have new "names" for shrimps and new breeders have some difficult to understand how classify your shrimps and what is the desired standard for each pattern.

The objective of this repository is create a database with information about these standards and to be a help for new breeders.
